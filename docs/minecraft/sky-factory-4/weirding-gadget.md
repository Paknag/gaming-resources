By default, a single Weirding Gadget will keep a 5x5 chunk area around it loaded, for a period of 3 days. The chunk loader will not deactivate if the player is online, and the inactivity period starts after they have logged off.

If the chunk loader has deactivated it will stop spinning, anyone can re-activate it by right clicking on it.

The Weirding Gadget now supports multiple players. Each person can Right click on it. The device will become inactive when ALL players have been offline for the specified period.
